Sacramento State’s Low Impact Development Tour

###LANDING PAGE INFO
In 2015, Sacramento State’s Office of Water Programs (OWP) and Facilities Management teamed with the City of Sacramento to install new stormwater management devices on campus. The devices, or low
impact development best management practices (LID BMPs), are intended to reduce stormwater impacts
to the American and Sacramento Rivers. Stormwater runoff from urban development is one of the leading contributors of water quality degradation. Take the tour to learn more.

This bioretention planter retains and treats stormwater from a parking lot. The planter was designed around the existing storm system infrastructure to minimize costs. The existing parking lots grades directed runoff to a drain inlet located in the middle of some parking stalls. Locating the planter around the existing drain inlet avoided the need for re-grading the parking lot. The existing drain inlet and storm sewer below provide a means for overflow and treated discharge in the case all runoff from the storm cannot be infiltrated.

This bioswale retains and treats stormwater from a driveway entrance to parking lot 7. The planter was designed around the existing storm system infrastructure to minimize costs. The existing driveway grades directed runoff to a drain inlet located adjacent to a vegetated planter. The convention grass planter was replaced with a bioswale in which a new, raised drain inlet was placed and tied into the existing storm drain system below.  Locating the bioswale here avoided the need for re-grading the driveway. Curb cuts were made along the length of the bioswale to allow runoff to enter. The new, raised drain inlet and existing storm sewer below provide a means for overflow and treated discharge in the case all runoff from the storm cannot be infiltrated.

###BMP SITE #3 SITE INFO PANEL DESCRIPTION #1
This bioretention planter retains and treats stormwater from a parking lot. The planter was designed around the existing storm system infrastructure to minimize costs. The parking lot was originally graded to drain runoff to a valley gutter located in the center of the lot, where drain inlets collect the runoff and divert it to subsurface storm drains that discharge to a west drainage ditch. The valley gutter and existing drain inlets were located in the middle of a drive aisle, making construction of bioretention planters impractical in those locations. To resolve this issue and still make use of some of the existing infrastructure, bioretention planters were constructed within parking stalls closest to the existing valley gutters. Additional gutters were constructed normal to the existing gutters to redirect runoff to the new planters. The existing drain inlets were removed and new drain inlets were placed within the new planters. The new inlets tie into the existing storm drain that discharges to the west ditch, and therefore allow a means of egress for overflows.

This unlined rain garden was installed to replace existing, lesser previous grass lawn and thus provide more retention and infiltration of runoff from the surrounding landscape and impervious walkways. This rain garden is unlined to allow runoff to infiltrate into the native soils below. The garden was built around the existing drain inlet, which provides a means for overflow to discharge in the case all runoff from a storm cannot be infiltrated.  A porous pavement walkway was installed adjacent to the rain garden to replace the existing decomposed granite path that was disturbed during construction of the rain garden.

This unlined rain garden retains and infiltrates stormwater from a building roof top. The original downspouts were directly plumbed to existing, subsurface storm drains, where roof runoff was directed toward and pumped over the levee and discharged into the American River. The rain garden was designed around the existing storm system infrastructure to minimize costs. To do this, the building downspouts were cut to disconnect them from the existing storm drain system.  Valley gutters were constructed under the cut downspouts to redirect runoff into the nearby rain garden. This rain garden is unlined to allow runoff to infiltrate into the native soils below. A new drain inlet and storm sewer were built and connected to the existing storm system nearby.  The drain inlet and storm sewer provide a means for overflow to discharge in the case all runoff from the storm cannot be infiltrated.  Porous pavement was installed adjacent to the rain garden to replace the existing lawn that was disturbed during construction of the rain garden.

Valley gutters were constructed under the cut downspouts to redirect runoff into the nearby rain garden. This rain garden was constructed in a fully lined concrete casing due to its proximity to the building; allowing runoff to infiltrate too close to the building can have adverse impacts on the foundation.

This unlined rain garden was installed to replace existing, lesser previous grass lawn and thus provide more retention and infiltration of runoff from the adjacent roadway and bike path. The garden was built by simply excavating a small area of existing lawn and underlying soils and replacing them with composted amended soils and specially selected vegetation that promote infiltration into the underlying soils (the garden is unlined). Two cuts were made in the existing curbs along the road to allow runoff to enter and exit the garden, if flows exceed the garden’s capacity.

This street features a mix of unlined rain gardens, porous pavement, and conventional landscaping with water-wise vegetation. The gardens and porous pavement were installed to allow infiltration of runoff into the native subsurface and reduce irrigation demands. The existing heritage trees were maintained as they provide valuable tree canopy for preventing urban heat exchange. The heritage trees and new gardens together provide soothing aesthetics that encourage pedestrian and bicycle use. The rain garden on the west side receives runoff from the western parking lot, which previously discharged directly to the storm drain system. The northern portion of the lot is drained into a cobble trench where runoff flows subsurface to the rain garden. The existing storm drains were capped to allow the runoff to reach the rain garden. The eastern rain gardens are interconnected such that runoff entering the northern-most and middle rain gardens flow to the southern-most garden, where a drain inlet can discharge any overflows exceeding the design capacity.  Subsurface piping juts diagonally west around the heritage trees to connect the rain gardens but protect the tree roots.  Porous pavement was installed along the east and west sides of the street which were converted to parallel parking stalls. The design included 11-foot drive aisles in attempt to slow traffic and provide a more pedestrian- and bike-friendly vibe. Unfortunately, based on feedback from delivery vehicle and bus drivers, these widths resulted in a perceived safety concern, and so the parallel parking along the east side of the road is now prohibited.

###BMP SITE #9 SITE INFO PANEL DESCRIPTION #1
At this location, stormwater runoff captured from the eastern side of campus is pumped over the levee and pumped into the American River. The runoff carries pollutants such as sediments, metals, and nutrients that adversely impact the river’s water quality and subsequently the beneficial uses (wildlife habitat, drinking water, recreation, etc.) the river provides. During big storms, large volumes of runoff result in erosion of the stream bank and cause further degradation of habitats and water quality downstream. To reduce these impacts, the university installed multiple stormwater retention and treatment devices, or low impact development best management practices (LID BMPs), on campus in 2014.  The types of LID BMPs implemented include a lined rain garden, unlined rain gardens, bioretention planters, and porous pavement. These devices reduce the volume of runoff discharged into the river by allowing it to infiltrate on site.  Some of the devices include compost-amended soils that are specifically designed to filter and adsorb pollutants, so runoff that is discharged is at least cleaner than had it not entered the LID BMP.
