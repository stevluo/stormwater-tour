        "description": "In 2015, Sacramento State\u2019s Office of Water Programs (OWP) and Facilities Management teamed with the City of Sacramento to install new stormwater management devices on campus.  Major funding was obtained through a Proposition 84 grant from the State Water Resources Control Board.  The City of Sacramento administered the grant. The Office of Water Programs provided technical oversight and Facilities Management provided construction management services. Facilities design and construction were performed by outside contractors, some of whom are listed below.\r\n\r\nThese facilities, also called Best Management Practices (BMPs), are intended to reduce stormwater impacts to the American and Sacramento Rivers. Stormwater runoff from urban development is one of the leading contributors of water quality degradation.  By fitting seamlessly into the built environment and maximizing opportunities to infiltrate runoff and reduce discharges to the rivers, these BMPs follow a design philosophy known as Low Impact Development (LID).\r\n\r\nOne purpose of this project is to provide opportunities for the public and stormwater professionals to see examples of how LID BMPs can be retrofitted to existing parking lots and streets. \u0007 Click here\b to read about design and construction challenges common to all the BMP installations.  Take the tour to see them.\r\n\r\nAll of the BMPs in this project were designed according to the 2015 Sacramento Stormwater Quality Partnership\u2019s Stormwater Quality Design Manual.  Detailed descriptions, drawings, specifications, and lessons learned can be found on our website at http://www.owp.csus.edu/csus-lid/.  \r\n"

If the runoff flow is larger than the garden\u2019s infiltration capacity, the garden fills up, which causes water in the street to bypass the curb cuts and flow to the existing drain inlet.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tBecause it does not require any pipes or channeling, this was an inexpensive BMP.  Actual costs at any particular site depend on local conditions, especially underground facilities.  At this site, the electrical wire for the street lamps had to be moved out from under the basins.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHow much water infiltrates depends on both the surface material and the permeability of the underlying soil.  Along College Town Dr. the existing soil permeability varies and some rain gardens are infiltrating more than others.  ",

        "description": "\u2022\tOn the east side of the street, an existing lawn was replaced with a 3-cell rain garden.  On the west side, angled street parking was removed to allow construction of rain gardens and a new sidewalk.  Parallel parking lanes with porous concrete pavement were installed on both sides of the street.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe rain gardens and porous pavement (see diagrams below) collect runoff and infiltrate it into the native soil.  In large storms, runoff that cannot be taken up by the soil overflows into the campus drain system and is conveyed to the American River.   \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe eastern rain garden is made up of three interconnected cells to preserve the roots of the existing trees.  Tree canopy is valuable for reducing urban heat exchange and encouraging pedestrian and bicycle use.  The existing heritage trees and new gardens are designed to aesthetically complement each other.  Runoff for this eastern garden comes from the parking lot around the police building. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe rain garden on the west side receives runoff from the parking lot between Jed Smith Dr. and Parking Structure 3.  The existing storm drains were capped to direct the runoff to the rain garden.  The northern portion of the lot drains into a cobble trench and the runoff flows underground to the rain garden.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe porous concrete pavement in the street is 6 inches deep on top of a 12 inch gravel base.  You can literally pour water on it from a bucket (click here to see video).  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tRetrofitting an existing street involved several design challenges:\r\n\r\no\tTo avoid impacting the roots of existing trees the rain garden on the west side was divided into three parts, connected with underground piping that juts diagonally around the trees.  (Look for shiny metal covers on the west side of the sidewalk between the rain garden cells.)\r\n\r\no\tTo minimize the loss of angled parking stalls, parallel parking was placed in the street and an adjacent off-street parking lot was expanded.\r\n\r\no\tTo reduce the total impervious area and accommodate the parallel parking, 11-foot drive aisles were provided.  Delivery truck and bus drivers, however, have expressed safety concerns and the parallel parking on the east side of the street has been closed while this issue is being addressed.",

A suspension style bridge was chosen so that the towers could be built on land rather than in the water.  At 1147 feet long, it was the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the U.S. at the time of its opening in 1967.  Its general design and color, International Orange, are designed to be reminiscent of the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n",
