        "description": "In 2015, Sacramento State\u2019s Office of Water Programs (OWP) and Facilities Management teamed with the City of Sacramento to install new stormwater management devices on campus.  Major funding was obtained through a Proposition 84 grant from the State Water Resources Control Board.  The City of Sacramento administered the grant. The Office of Water Programs provided technical oversight and Facilities Management provided construction management services. Facilities design and construction were performed by outside contractors, some of whom are listed below.\r\n\r\nThese facilities, also called Best Management Practices (BMPs), are intended to reduce stormwater impacts to the American and Sacramento Rivers. Stormwater runoff from urban development is one of the leading contributors of water quality degradation.  By fitting seamlessly into the built environment and maximizing opportunities to infiltrate runoff and reduce discharges to the rivers, these BMPs follow a design philosophy known as Low Impact Development (LID).\r\n\r\nOne purpose of this project is to provide opportunities for the public and stormwater professionals to see examples of how LID BMPs can be retrofitted to existing parking lots and streets. \u0007 Click here\b to read about design and construction challenges common to all the BMP installations.  Take the tour to see them.\r\n\r\nAll of the BMPs in this project were designed according to the 2015 Sacramento Stormwater Quality Partnership\u2019s Stormwater Quality Design Manual.  Detailed descriptions, drawings, specifications, and lessons learned can be found on our website at http://www.owp.csus.edu/csus-lid/.  \r\n"

A suspension style bridge was chosen so that the towers could be built on land rather than in the water.  At 1147 feet long, it was the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the U.S. at the time of its opening in 1967.  Its general design and color, International Orange, are designed to be reminiscent of the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n",
