In turn, the gravel provides an additional storage component and allows infiltration into the underlying native soils.  The porous pavement used for this project is approximately four to eight inches thick with an additional four to eight inches of gravel subbase.  ",

A perforated underdrain is located at the top of the gravel storage area to allow runoff to discharge to the existing storm sewer in case the underlying soils and gravel storage become saturated.

The heritage trees and new gardens together provide soothing aesthetics that encourage pedestrian and bicycle use.   The rain garden on the west side receives runoff from the western parking lot, which previously discharged directly to the storm drain system.  The northern portion of the lot is drained into a cobble trench where runoff flows subsurface to the rain garden.  The existing storm drains were capped to allow the runoff to reach the rain garden.  The eastern rain gardens are interconnected such that runoff entering the northern-most and middle rain gardens flow to the southern-most garden, where a drain inlet can discharge any overflows exceeding the design capacity.   Subsurface piping juts diagonally west around the heritage trees to connect the rain gardens but protect the tree roots.  Porous pavement was installed along the east and west sides of the street which were converted to parallel parking stalls.

During big storms, large volumes of runoff result in erosion of the stream bank and cause further degradation of habitats and water quality downstream.  To reduce these impacts, the university installed multiple stormwater retention and treatment devices, or low impact development best management practices (LID BMPs), on campus in 2014.  The types of LID BMPs implemented include a lined rain garden, unlined rain gardens, bioretention planters, and porous pavement.  These devices reduce the volume of runoff discharged into the river by allowing it to infiltrate on site.  Some of the devices include compost-amended soils that are specifically designed to filter and absorb pollutants, so runoff that is discharged is at least cleaner than had it not entered the LID BMP.",
